Lab_1:\
Topic: Semi Global Stereo Matching with Monocular Disparity Initial Guess.\
Goal: Disparity maps estimation of stereo images.

Lab_2:\
Topic: Structure from Motion\
Goal: Estimate the 3D structure of a small scene taken by your smartphone from a sequence of images with some field-of-view overlaps.

Lab_3:\
Topic: Iterative Closest Point Cloud Registration.\
Goal: Given a source and a target point cloud roughly aligned, find the fine alignment transformation of the source to the target cloud.

Lab_4:\
Topic: Deep 3D descriptors.\
Goal: Design a modified PointNet architecture that is able to extract 3D descriptors to be used for matching. Replace the initial 3x3 T-Net with a rotation matrix extracted as in the
Local Reference Frame of SHOT descriptors.
